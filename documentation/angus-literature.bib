	abstract = {Defining the long-term development of Germany׳s energy sector, has been the subject of a series of studies carried out by governmental, industrial and independent interest groups. These studies play a significant role in energy political debate for understanding the long-term role of bioenergy in the national energy system. However, a deep insight and critical assessment of these studies is necessary to increase their transparency and traceability for policy and research. This article aims to provide with information for better understanding energy scenarios and to interpret the expectations of the role that bioenergy can play in 2050. Firstly, 18 long-term energy scenarios were selected based on defined criteria, and analyzed in details in terms of their goals, methods, data used and obtained results. Furthermore, four specific bioenergy-related indicators were selected to carry out a quantitative analysis and interpretation across the selected studies. The results for the four indicators show a high uncertainty and a wide range of potential bioenergy development futures in Germany by 2050 – e.g. the sustainable domestic biomass potential ranges from 350 to 1700PJ, the share of biomass in final energy consumption lies between 5 and 28\% – principally due to the different key questions and methods and heterogeneous driving forces. The study provides with recommendations for energy scenario users for quality measures (e.g. traceability and transparency of methods and data) and contextualization of the results},

	abstract = {Pumped hydro energy storage (PHS) currently is the only electricity grid storage technology with substantial deployment throughout the world, representing over 99\% of storage capacity, but other storage technologies such as batteries are increasingly finding application. In Europe, the implementation of storage systems is expected to increase because of the integration of intermittent, nondispatchable renewable energy sources. Nevertheless, there is no overview available of the power and energy ratings of large-scale stationary storage at the supranational level. In the absence of officially collected statistics on energy capacity, publicly available information is collected from storage owners, freely accessible databases, scientific articles, reports, brochures and government websites. The status of PHS and other large-scale storage technologies in the EU-28 countries, supplemented by Norway and Switzerland, is presented. First, this paper defines a measure of energy storage capacity, to allow comparison of pumped hydro storage plants with other storage technologies. Next, a set of technical parameters of current large-scale storage plants is presented, as well as an overview of planned storage projects. The estimate of PHS power ratings in the EU-28 exceeds previous estimates, with a total of 160 plants and 45.283GW rated power in turbine mode and a full cycle storage capacity of 602GWh. When adding Norway and Switzerland, a total of 188 operational PHS plants is shown with 1313GWh. The data is used to obtain EU-wide discharge curves and national indicators of utilization and significance.},
