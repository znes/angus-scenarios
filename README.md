# ANGUS2 Project Scenario Calculations

## Preparation

If you want to build the packages for scenarios all you need to do is run some
scripts. Clone the directory and `cd` to the root diectory. From here all
commands are to be executed from the console.

### Requirements

To run the script, make sure the requirements e.g. via pip

    pip install  -U -r requirements.txt

In addition for some plots `plotly-orca`. Installation instructions can
found here: [orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca)

### Raw data

To run the build script the required raw data needs to be downloaded. Generally,
the data will be downloaded automatically. You have to create an  `oemof-raw-data`
directory in your home folder:


    mkdir /home/user/oemof-raw-data

## Build

To build the package locally run the python script

    python scripts/build.py

This will initialize all directories if they don't exist, (download raw data),
create the meta-data file. The output data are stored under:

    /datapackages

### Configuration build files

The datapackages are build with the provided .toml-files provided in the
`/scenarios` folder. You can adapt the configuration files or add new ones to
your needs. All datapackages are build in parallel. If you want to build single
datapackages you can use the `build.py` function.


## Compute

To compute the datapackages run:

    python scripts/compute.py

  This will create a results directory with all results.

### Existing Datapackages

**The provided datapackages in the datapackage directory of this repository
may be outdated. Therefore you should rebuild the datapackages based on the provided
`scripts/build.py` script.**


## Plots

Plots can be generated by:

    python scripts/analysis.py


# Model assumptions

The Model is based on the NEP2030 version 2019.  


## Demand

* Demand profiles are calculated from the OPSD dataset of the ENTSOE
timeseries for the selected weather year.
* German demand is based on the NEP2030 scenarios (A2030, B2030, C2030)
* The amount of demand of the neigbouring countries is based on the TYNDP2018
scenario for 2030 'Sustainable Transition'. For the NEP2030C, the TYNDP
*Vision 2030 DG* has been chosen, for NEP2030A *VisionEU* has been used.


## Conventional generation

* Generation capacities are based on for the Vision 2030DG and 2030 EUCO of
the TYNDP2018 for neigbouring countries
* German generation is derived from the NEP2030 scenarios
* Efficiencies are based on own assumptions for non-german countries. However,
the data of the TYNDP2018 has been used as a foundation. For
germany the OPSD powerplant register is used to calculate efficiencies for
the conventional powerplants in 2030.
* Costs are based on the NEP2030C and TYNDP cost assumptions

## Renewables

* Maximum biomass potential per country the hotmaps potential is used. The
installed capacity of biomass is assumed to be `biofuels` and `others-res`
from the TNYDP2018.
* Renewable capacities for wind and pv are based on the TYNDP2018 for non german
countries.
* For the renewable profiles of wind and pv timeseries of renewables ninja has
been used.
* Hydro capacities are assumend to be the same as in 2015. The inflow in run of river and
reservoirs is modelled based on the inflow timeseries of the Restore2050 project.

## Must Run

* For the NEP2030C scenario, CHP power plants smaller 10MW are modelled as must-run
with a seasonal profile.
* For the NEP2030A scenario, > 30 GW installed conventional powerplants are must
run with the seasonal profile.
* Must run plants are modelled with marginal cost of zero.
