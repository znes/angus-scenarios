# ANGUS2 Project Scenario Calculations

## Preparation

If you want to build the packages for scenarios all you need to do is run some
scripts. Clone the directory and `cd` to the root diectory. From here all
commands are to be executed from the console.

### Requirements

To run the script, make sure the requirements e.g. via pip

    pip install  -U -r requirements.txt

In addition for some plots `plotly-orca`. Installation instructions can
found here: [orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca)

### Raw data

To run the build script the required raw data needs to be downloaded. Generally,
the data will be downloaded automatically. You have to create an  `oemof-raw-data`
directory in your home folder:


    mkdir /home/user/oemof-raw-data

If raw data does not exist run:

    python scripts/prepare.py

## Build

To generate sensitivities on existing scenario toml files run (adapt):

    python scripts/generate_sensitivities.py

To build the package locally run the python script

    python scripts/build.py

This will initialize all directories if they don't exist, (download raw data),
create the meta-data file. The output data are stored under:

    /datapackages

### Configuration build files

The datapackages are build with the provided .toml-files provided in the
`/scenarios` folder. You can adapt the configuration files or add new ones to
your needs. All datapackages are build in parallel. If you want to build single
datapackages you can use the `build.py` function.

The packages will be build with the multiprocessing package. Make sure that
all files exis in the raw data path, for example by running the building
process for only one file without multiprocessing. Sometimes errors occure
in combination with downloading and unzipping multiple file with multiprocessing. 

## Compute

To compute the datapackages run:

    python scripts/compute.py

  This will create a results directory with all results.

### Existing Datapackages

**The provided datapackages in the datapackage directory of this repository
may be outdated. Therefore you should rebuild the datapackages based on the provided
`scripts/build.py` script.**


## Plots

Plots can be generated by:

    python scripts/analysis.py
